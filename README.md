# Udacity Capstone Project - Dog Breed Classification

This work is a capstone project required in Udacity Nanodegree program and employes the use of the Convolutional Neural Network to create a classifier to predict the dog breeds given an input image.

- PyTorch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Data augmentation
- OpenCV pre-trained face detectors (haarcascades & lbpcascade)
- Pre-trained VGG-16 convolutional network
- Pre-trained ResNet_50 convolutional network
